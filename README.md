- Tells jokes when asked specifically for one.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- spaCy library (`pip install spacy`)
- English language model for spaCy (`python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`)

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies as mentioned above.
2. Run the `chatbot.py` script.

You: Tell me a joke
Chatbot: What do you call a fish with no eyes? Fsh!
You: How are you feeling today?
Chatbot: I don't have emotions like humans do, but I can analyze patterns in language to understand sentiment. How are you feeling today?
